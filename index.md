I've created this page to host some deep dives into complex systems, starting with a walkthough of the internal parameter 'world' of the Llama 2 large language model.  My background is in spectroscopy and quantum mechanical modeling/analysis of advanced materials, which means that I like to pull apart and visuallize high dimensional objects to learn about how they work.
