I've created this page to host some deep dives into complex systems, starting with a walkthrough of the internal parameter 'world' of the Llama 2 large language model.  My background is in spectroscopy and quantum mechanical modeling/analysis of advanced materials. This means that I like to pull apart and visualize high dimensional objects to learn about how they work - and then to see what I can get from building new things with similar ingredients.
